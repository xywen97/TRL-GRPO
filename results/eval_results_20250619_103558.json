According to CRT, if we have two congruences: x ≡ a (mod m) and x ≡ b (mod n), where m and n are coprime, there exists a unique solution modulo mn. Here, a = 1, m = 7, b = 1, and n = 11. We need to find x such that x ≡ 1 (mod 7) and x ≡ 1 (mod 11). This simplifies to finding x such that x - 1 is divisible by both 7 and 11. Since 7 and 11 are coprime, the least common multiple of 7 and 11 is 77. Thus, x - 1 must be a multiple of 77. Therefore, x = 77k + 1 for some integer k. The smallest natural number greater than 1 occurs when k = 1, giving us x = 77 * 1 + 1 = 78. </think><answer>78</answer>",

Let \\(s\\) be the side length of the cube. The space diagonal \\(d\\) of a cube with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[ d = s\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nSince the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius:\n\\[ d = 2r \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for the space diagonal:\n\\[ s\\sqrt{3} = 2r \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(r = \\sqrt[3]{3\\sqrt{3}}\\) into the equation:\n\\[ s\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt[3]{3\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\nSolve for \\(s\\):\n\\[ s = \\frac{2\\sqrt[3]{3\\sqrt{3}}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the expression for \\(s\\)\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt[3]{3\\sqrt{3}}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), note that:\n\\[ \\sqrt[3]{3\\sqrt{3}} = (3\\sqrt{3})^{1/3} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ s =",

Find all positive integers \\( M \\) such that for every positive integer \\( k \\) not exceeding \\( M \\), \\( S(Mk) = S(M) \\). To solve the problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( M \\) such that for every positive integer \\( k \\) not exceeding \\( M \\), the sum of the digits of \\( Mk \\) is equal to the sum of the digits of \\( M \\). Let's denote the sum of the digits of a number \\( x \\) by \\( S(x) \\).\n\nFirst, consider the case when \\( M \\) is a single-digit number. If \\( M \\) is a single-digit number, say \\( M = d \\) where \\( d \\) is a digit from 1 to 9, then \\( S(M) = d \\). For any \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( M \\), \\( Mk \\) will be a number whose digits are influenced by the multiplication of \\( M \\) by \\( k \\). However, the sum of the digits of \\( Mk \\) will generally not be equal to \\( d \\) unless \\( k \\) is specifically chosen to make this happen, which is highly unlikely for all \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( M \\). Therefore, \\( M \\) cannot be a single-digit number.\n\nNext, consider the case when \\( M \\) is a two-digit number. Let \\( M = 10a + b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits (i.e., \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq 9 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq b \\leq 9 \\)). We need to check if there exists a \\( M \\) such that \\( S(Mk) = S(M) \\) for all \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( M \\). \n\nConsider \\( M = 99 \\). Here, \\( S(99) = 9 + 9 = 18 \\). Now, we need to check if \\( S(99k) = 18 \\) for all \\( k \\) from 1 to 99. Notice that \\( 99k \\) can be written as \\( 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k = 99k \\). When \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to 99, the sum of the digits of \\( 99k \\",
    "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the condition \\( S(Mk) = S(M) \\) for \\( k \\) not exceeding \\( M \\). The function \\( S(n) \\) sums the digits of \\( n \\). One approach to solve this problem is to observe that \\( S(n) \\) is congruent to \\( n \\mod 9 \\) (because the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) modulo 9 is equal to \\( n \\mod 9 \\)).\n\nThus, the condition \\( S(Mk) = S(M) \\) can be transformed into \\( Mk \\equiv M \\pmod{9} \\). This implies:\n\\[ M(k - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( k \\) can be any positive integer not exceeding \\( M \\), \\( M \\) must be such that \\( M \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\). Therefore, \\( M \\) must be a multiple of 9.\n\nLet's verify this using Python and sympy.\n\nWe'll implement a function to check the condition for positive integers \\( M \\) that are multiples of 9 up to a reasonable bound (since \\( M \\) can be very large, we will check up to a certain number).\n\nHere is the Python code to find all such \\( M \\):\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef S(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n\n# Check for multiples of 9 up to a reasonable bound\ndef find_valid_M(bound):\n    valid_M = []\n    for M in range(9, bound+1, 9):\n        valid = True\n        for k in range(1, M+1):\n            if S(M*k) != S(M):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_M.append(M)\n    return valid_M\n\n# Set a bound for checking\nbound = 1000\nvalid_M = find_valid_M(bound)\nprint(valid_M)\n```\n```output\n[9, 99, 999]\n```\nThe output of the code shows that the positive integers \\( M \\) up to 1000 that satisfy the condition \\( S(Mk) = S(M) \\) for every positive integer \\( k \\) not exceeding \\( M \\) are:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9, 99, 999} \\]\n\nThese values of \\( M \\) are all multiples of 9 and meet the given condition.",

    "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to clarify what \"5 rinds\" means in terms of the geometry of cutting a watermelon. Typically, a watermelon rind is the outer skin that is left after the inner flesh has been eaten. However, the problem seems to be a bit ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, let's interpret \"5 rinds\" as having 5 separate pieces of the outer rind after cutting the watermelon into 4 pieces.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We start with one whole watermelon.\n   - We cut it into 4 pieces.\n   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with 5 separate pieces of rind.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight:**\n   - When you cut a watermelon, each cut typically creates a new piece of rind (or extends an existing piece), unless cuts are specifically made to separate the rind into smaller pieces.\n   - For 5 rinds to result from 4 cuts, there must have been some way to isolate and separate the pieces of rind during the cutting process.\n\n3. **Visualization and Reasoning:**\n   - Let's visualize the process. If the watermelon is cut strategically, it might be possible to create additional separate pieces of rind from the existing cuts.\n\nWe can approach this with a combinatorial and logical reasoning approach. However, this problem is more conceptual and might not need a complex sympy solution. Let’s reason it out:\n\n1. **Initial Rind:**\n   - Initially, there is 1 whole rind.\n\n2. **First Cut:**\n   - The first cut will split the watermelon into 2 pieces, creating 2 rinds.\n\n3. **Second Cut:**\n   - The second cut will add another piece, making it 3 rinds.\n\n4. **Third Cut:**\n   - The third cut can add another piece, making it 4 rinds.\n\n5. **Fourth Cut:**\n   - The fourth cut can add another piece, making it 5 rinds.\n\nSo, theoretically, it is possible to end up with 5 separate pieces of rind after 4 cuts if the cuts are done strategically.\n\nLet's write a simple Python logic to simulate this scenario and ensure our reasoning is correct.\n\n```python\ndef can_create_rinds(cuts, target_rinds):\n    # Initial state\n    initial_rinds = 1\n    \n    # Each cut can potentially add one new rind piece\n    # Simulate the process\n    for cut in range(cuts):\n        initial_rinds += 1\n        if initial_rinds == target_rinds:\n            return True\n    \n    return initial_rinds >= target_rinds\n\n# Define the number of cuts and the target number of rinds\ncuts = 4\ntarget_rinds = 5\n\n# Check if it's possible to create the target rinds with the given cuts\nresult = can_create_rinds(cuts, target_rinds)\nprint(result)  # Should be True if it's possible\n```\n```output\nTrue\n```\nThe result from the Python code indicates that it is indeed possible to achieve 5 separate pieces of rind with 4 cuts.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem \"Could 5 rinds result if students from the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology, while on summer vacation, cut a watermelon into 4 pieces and ate it?\" is \\(\\boxed{\\text{True}}\\).",

    "solution": "To solve this problem step-by-step, we will use Python and the Sympy library.

To resolve this, we need to iterate symbolically and ensure we handle the symbolic comparisons appropriately.\n\nWe will use Sympy's capabilities to handle symbolic expressions and their comparisons. Let's adjust the code to properly implement this:\n\n1. **Part (I)** - Solve for \\(p\\) when the sequence is constant.\n2. **Part (II)** - Verify the inequality \\(a_n < a_{n+1}\\) for \\(p > 1\\).\n3. **Part (III)** - Find the maximum positive value of \\(p\\) such that \\(a_n < 2\\).\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\na = sp.symbols('a')\n\n# Part (I) - Constant Sequence\n# a = (1/4)*a^2 + p\np = sp.symbols('p')\nconstant_eq = sp.Eq(a, (1/4)*a**2 + p)\np_value = sp.solve(constant_eq, p)[0]\n\n# Part (II) - Prove a_n < a_{n+1} when p > 1\n# a_n < (1/4)*a_n^2 + p\na_n = sp.symbols('a_n')\ninequality = a_n < (1/4)*a_n**2 + p\n\n# Part (III) - Find the maximum positive value of p such that a_n < 2\n# Start with a_1 = 1 and ensure a_n stays under 2\na_n = sp.Rational(1)  # Starting value a_1 = 1\nmax_p = sp.Rational(0)\n\n# Iteratively find the max p such that a_n < 2 for all n\nfor _ in range(100):  # A reasonable number of iterations to determine boundedness\n    a_next = (1/4) * a_n**2 + max_p\n    if a_next >= 2:\n        break\n    max_p += 0.01  # Incrementing p to find the maximum value before a_n exceeds 2\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Part (I) - Constant sequence value of p:\", p_value)\nprint(\"Part (II) - Inequality a_n < a_{n+1} when p > 1:\", sp.simplify(inequality.subs(p, 1)))\nprint(\"Part (III) - Maximum positive value of p:\", max_p)\n```\n```output\nPart (I) - Constant sequence value of p: 0.25*a*(4.0 - a)\nPart (II) - Inequality a_n < a_{n+1} when p > 1: 0.25*a_n**2 - 1.0*a_n > -1.0\nPart (III) - Maximum positive value of p: 1.00000000000000\n```\nGreat! The output provides the results for each part of the problem. Let's interpret each part:\n\n### Part (I)\nIf the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is a constant sequence, we found the value of $p$ by solving the equation \\(a = \\frac{1}{4}a^2 + p\\):\n\n\\[ p = 0.25a(4 - a) \\]\n\n### Part (II)\nWe need to prove that \\(a_n < a_{n+1}\\) when \\(p > 1\\). The inequality simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}a_n^2 - a_n > -1\\]\n\nThis inequality holds true when \\(p > 1\\), meaning that \\(a_n\\) is indeed less than \\(a_{n+1}\\) when \\(p > 1\\).\n\n### Part (III)\nWe need to find the maximum positive value of \\(p\\) such that \\(a_n < 2\\) holds for all integers \\(n\\). The iterative numerical approach found that the maximum value of \\(p\\) is:\n\n\\[ p = 1.00000000000000 \\]\n\nThis means that if \\(p\\) is greater than 1, \\(a_n\\) will eventually exceed 2 for some \\(n\\), but if \\(p = 1\\), \\(a_n\\) remains less than 2 for all \\(n\\).\n\nWe have successfully solved the problem using reasoning and Python code with Sympy. The final answers are:\n\n1. For the sequence to be constant, \\( p = 0.25a(4 - a) \\).\n2. \\(a_n < a_{n+1}\\) is true when \\( p > 1 \\).\n3. The maximum positive value of \\( p \\) such that \\( a_n < 2 \\) holds for all \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

The solution indicates that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda < 0 \\text{ and } \\lambda \\neq -1}\n\\]\n\nThe condition \\(\\lambda \\neq -1\\) is already given in the problem statement. Therefore, the range of values for \\(\\lambda\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\lambda < 0} \\]\n\nThis is the final result. Thank you for your patience!",
