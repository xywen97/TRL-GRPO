No two cards of the same color are placed consecutively.\n\n### Objective\n- Determine the color of the 26th card.\n\n### Reasoning\nGiven that no two cards of the same color can be consecutive, the cards must alternate in colors. However, we need to respect the specific placements of the 10th, 11th, and 25th cards.\n\nLet's outline the logic step-by-step:\n1. From cards 1 to 9, the sequence must alternate starting with either red or black.\n2. The 10th and 11th cards are red, so the 9th card must be black.\n3. The 25th card is black.\n\nGiven that the 25th card is black and no two consecutive cards can be the same color, the 26th card must be red.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python code to simulate the sequence and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the sequence with the given constraints\nsequence = []\n\n# Fill in the sequence up to the 10th card\nfor i in range(9):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        sequence.append('B')  # Even positions (starting from 0): B\n    else:\n        sequence.append('R')  # Odd positions (starting from 0): R\n\n# 10th and 11th cards are red\nsequence.append('R')\nsequence.append('R')\n\n# Continue the sequence until the 25th card\nfor i in range(12, 25):\n    if sequence[-1] == 'R':\n        sequence.append('B')\n    else:\n        sequence.append('R')\n\n# The 25th card must be black\nsequence.append('B')\n\n# Determine the color of the 26th card\nif sequence[-1] == 'B':\n    sequence.append('R')\nelse:\n    sequence.append('B')\n\n# The 26th card is:\ntwenty_sixth_card = sequence[25]\nprint(twenty_sixth_card)\n```\n```output\nR\n```\nThe output confirms that the 26th card is red.\n\nHence, the color of the 26th card laid out is \\(\\boxed{\\text{red}}\\).",
